# Avalanche data and predictions

This repository contains some of the work I've done with avalanche predictions.

Of particular interest to anyone who wishes to look at some of the more interesting
results, will be the iPython Notebook [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/philngo/avalanche-exploration/master/code/Avalanche%20data%20analysis.ipynb?create=1).
