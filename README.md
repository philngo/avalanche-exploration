# Avalanche data and predictions

This repository contains some of the work I've done with avalanche predictions in
the Wasatch Mountain range. The proximity of the Wasatch range to the Salt Lake
valley makes it a popular destination for back-country skiiers and splitboarders.
As such, the importance of having accurate measures of avalanche danger cannot
be overstated.

## Data sources
Utah Avalanche Center (UAC)
North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM)
Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC)

## iPython Notebook
Of particular interest to anyone who wishes to look at some of the more interesting
results will be the iPython Notebook [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/philngo/avalanche-exploration/master/code/Avalanche%20data%20analysis.ipynb?create=1).

## Disclaimer
Results and predictions from this model *cannot replace* on-the-ground training
in avalanche safety and rescue, nor can it alleviate the need for adequate
equipment and travel companions.
