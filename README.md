# Avalanche data and predictions

This repository contains some of the work I've done with avalanche predictions in
the Wasatch Mountain range. The proximity of the Wasatch range to the Salt Lake
valley makes it a popular destination for back-country skiiers and splitboarders.
As such, the importance of having accurate measures of avalanche danger cannot
be overstated.

## Data sources
Utah Avalanche Center (UAC)
North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) ftp://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/NAM/Grid218
Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC)

## iPython Notebook
This [iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/philngo/avalanche-exploration/master/code/Avalanche%20data%20analysis.ipynb?create=1)
) will be of particular interest to anyone who wishes to look at some of the
more interesting results.

## Disclaimer
Results and predictions from this model *cannot replace* on-the-ground training
in avalanche safety and rescue, nor can it alleviate the need for adequate
equipment and travel companions.

### Caveats
- missing data from the first 3 hours of 2012-02-06, replaced it with the second
 three hours instead
- See discussion in iPython Notebook concerning the limitations of the UAC data,
 which is crowd-sourced and potentially inaccurate.
